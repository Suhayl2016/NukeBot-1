# How to host?
## It's possible to host T-Nuker [using repl.it](https://replit.com/github/sub1337/NukeBot) to host the bot, but it is recommended to use your very own vps.

# Personal Rating
### It's gonna work very well if you try to nuke a server with 100 - 150 members.
### I HIGHLY do not recommend using it on a server with above 1000 members.
